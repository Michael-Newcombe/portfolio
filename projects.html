                  <h2>Describe My Location</h2>
                  <p>Describe My Location is a mobile web app I developed for my 3rd-year project at university. The app aims to aid people who are visually impaired when they are walking along a street, by describing their physical surroundings, using a computer vision and machine learning technique called image captioning. This is where a computer tries to describe an image in a natural language. The difference between this app and other visual aid apps that use image captioning is that Describe My Location does not require the user to take a picture of their surroundings using their device's camera. Instead, the app uses a street view image based on the user's current geographical location as a reference for their surroundings. This works by retrieving the latitude and longitude coordinates of the user's device, in addition to this, the app also takes into account the direction the user is facing by retrieving the heading direction of the user's device. This information is then passed into a Bing Maps API to download a street view image based on those coordinates. The street view image is then, passed into a pre-trained image captioning model called DenseCap, which generates a text description for the image. The text description is then, passed into a text to speech system so that the text, can be outputted as speech for visually impaired users. The app also allows users to upload images using their device's camera as well as images saved on their device. This is in case the geolocation feature is not working, for example, if there is no street view image coverage for a specific location. I developed this app using the Python web framework Flask along with SASS for the styling and vanilla JavaScript for the user interactivity.</p>

                  <h2>Tedbree Wedding App</h2>
                  <p>While working as a Front End Web Developer Intern at Tedbree Digital, I was tasked with turning prototype designs created by the company's design team into source code, as well as assisting the lead developer with the development of current projects. This consisted of developing interactive websites and static website templates using Vue.js. One of Tedbree Digital prototypes was for a wedding app designed to simplify the wedding process by allowing the user to plan out the entire wedding process such as booking a venue and hiring a photographer using a single app. For this specific prototype, I was tasked, with developing a static template in Vue.js based on the prototype design created by the design team. Therefore if the company decided to develop this product, they would already have a template to work with, also so that the lead developer could see how this prototype looked when turned into source code.</p>

                  <h2>TedbreeSocial</h2>
                  <p>During my time at Tedbree Digital, I was tasked, with assisting the lead developer with the development of current projects, one of which was for a web app called TedbreeSocial. TedbreeSocial is a social media and marketing platform designed to increase a company's online presence by helping the user with marketing the right content to the right audience. This is done, through search engine optimization driven social media posts, creative videos, blog outreach and sharing on multiple social media platforms. For this project, I assisted the lead developer with the front end side of the app such as the website navigation, testing different designs for each of the tabs using dummy data and making sure all the content is fully responsive. I did this in Vue.js using where I used the framework tailwind CSS for the app styling. I was also introduced to some of the backend development for the app which was implemented in PHP using the framework Laravel. TedbreeSocial is now a live product where more information can be found below.</p>

                  <h2>Hows The Weather Sounding</h2>
                  <p>Hows The Weather Sounding, is a joint 2nd-year university project that generates sound through algorithmic composition by converting weather data into audio. The application fetches weather data in JSON format through an API called OpenWeatherMap, the weather data is then converted and passed into an audio synthesizer which generates the sound. The weather data the application uses is, based on the current weather in a city. The application comes with 10 different default cities for the user to chose from, in addition to this, the user can also type in a city. The exact weather data the application uses is the current temperature, min temperature, max temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, wind direction, and cloud percentage. Once a sound has been generated the user can also fine turn a sound by changing the parameters of the synthesizer. These parameters are the number of oscillators, frequency, attack, decay, release, amplitude modulation, frequency modulation and index modulation. The application is written in C++ using the framework openFrameworks along with additional openFrameworks libraries, ofxMaxim, ofxJSON and ofxDatGui.</p>

                  <p>An audio visualizer application, developed in my 3rd-year of university, that renders 3D primitive objects which react to different aspects of the music. This works, using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) which, extracts different audio features from the sound, these features are the peak frequency, spectral centroid, and information from an octave analyzer. This data is then, used to manipulate the 3D primitive objects as well as change the lighting. In total, there are three different songs and three different shapes to chose from. The application is written in C++ using the framework openFrameworks along with additional openFrameworks library ofxMaxim.</p>

                  <h2>Giant Escape</h2>
                  <p>A group VR project developed in my 3rd-year of university. Giant Escape is an escape room game where the player is given an allotted time to complete 3 different puzzles. The storyline of the game is that the player has been captured by giants that want to sacrifice the player, therefore they must escape before this happens. To figure out the puzzles, the player must look for notes hidden inside the room, these notes contain riddles that give the player clues on how to complete a puzzle. The notes have been written by a person who was previously captured by the giants, however, they did not manage to escape. Once the player has figured out a puzzle, a key will appear that must be picked up and placed on the correct platform. There are 3 keys in total that the play must find, once all 3 keys have been found and placed on the correct platforms the player wins the game and escapes the giants. The game is developed using Unity, along with a library called VRTK which was used to implement the VR functionality, also the game was developed using the HTC VIVE. Furthermore, to create a more immersive VR experience the game uses a locomotion technique called walk in place, instead of the more commonly used, teleportation technique. This means to move around within the game, the player must move their arms up and down, similar to how they would in real life when walking.</p>

                  <h2>Battle Royale AI</h2>
                  <p>A battle royal style game developed in Unity from a third-year module I undertook at university. In this game, there are two teams of bots which fight against each other. Both of the teams consist of 25 bots, where the bots on the same team all share the same AI. The AI is implemented using an API that comes with the game which consists of various actions for a bot such as attacking, healing and fleeing, however, a bot can only perform one these actions at a time. The benchmark AI was a simple but effective AI which only ever attacked. For my AI a bot would only attack an enemy if one of its teams was nearby, if this was not the case then the bot would flee to the closest teammate. My AI would also heal the bot but only if an enemy was out of shooting range. Our bots also had to fight other bots from other students in the class to see which students had created the best AI. In this competition, my AI came in 10th place out of 45 other AI’s</p>

                  <h2>Keep Your Head In The Game</h2>
                  <p>Keep Your Head In The Game is a joint web-based game/app project for mobile devices that uses geolocation technology, developed in my 1st-year of university. The storyline of the game is a mystery narrative where the player has accidentally travelled back in time, where they must find there way back by finding various notes. To play the game the player has to physically walk to different locations situated around Goldsmiths, University of London, which are based, on geographic coordinates. These locations must also be, found in a specific order. Once the player has found the current location, the next location is unlocked, this reveals more of the story and gives the player clues on where the next location could be. To complete the game, the player must find all of the locations. The game is written in JavaScript using the library P5.js along with the additional P5 library, p5.geolocation.</p>

                  <h2>Music And Machine Learning</h2>
                  <p>An interactive work of music developed in my 3rd-year of university, where music is, controlled using hand movement through a computer webcam. This works using a JavaScript library called Handtrack.js to capture the x/y position and the width/height of a users hand. This data is then sent over OSC to a machine learning software called Wekinator. Wekinator is then used to train a machine learning model that can control audio effects based on hand movement. This works by sending OSC messages from Wekinator to an openFrameworks application called AbletonOSC which controls audio effect parameters inside a digital audio workstation, called Ableton Live, again through OSC messages.</p>
